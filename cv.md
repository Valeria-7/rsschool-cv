## About me

I am a fourth-year student of BSUIR. I am interested in **Web Development** and I am able to create simple web pages. I use free resources for self-education. I am going to learn new skills that will be enough for employment in a company.

## Skills

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- Git, GitHub
- Figma

## Code example

**Colour Association KATA from CODEWARS:** You are given a 2D array, composed of a colour and its 'common' association in each array element. The function you will write needs to return the colour as 'key' and association as its 'value'.

```JavaScript
function colourAssociation(array){
  let arrayOfObjects = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    let myObj = {};
    myObj[array[i][0]] = array[i][1];
    arrayOfObjects.push(myObj);
  }

  return arrayOfObjects;
}
```
